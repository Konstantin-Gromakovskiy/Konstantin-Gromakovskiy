# Hi there! I'm Kostya! 👋


## Frontend-developer 

I'm a frontend developer (React, TypeScript, Redux) and tutor for students in [Hexlet](https://github.com/Hexlet) who genuinely loves what I do. I value the opportunity to create user-friendly and meaningful products that help clients and support the team.
I enjoy collaborating with teammates, breaking down tasks into clear steps, and turning them into working digital solutions.
I write clean, readable code and constantly explore new technologies to improve my skills.
I thrive in friendly teams and always aim to bring value to the business through thoughtful development and communication
